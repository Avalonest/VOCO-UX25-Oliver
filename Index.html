                    <h3>Republic of Estonia (1918-1939)</h3>
                    <p>The Republic of Estonia came about during the Russian Civil War, fighting against the Russians, be it the Whites or Bolsheviks, in order to gain an independent estonian state. During the latter part of the war, Estonia and the whites cooperated in fighting against the Bolsheviks, which the new Estonian government viewed as a greater threat then a republican Russia. The Independence war was ended with the treaty of Tartu, with both nations ceasing hostilities between eachother, both nations recognizing each others borders and legitimacy.</p>
                    <p>The early period of the republic was filled with repair and reconstruction efforts from wartime damages. In the second half of the 1920s, the nation experienced noticable economic growth through foreign investments, especially from the USA but also from the Russian Republic, United Kingdom and the scandinavian countries. The government at that time was divided between the progressive side and conservative side, but the government didn't have any gridlock at the time.</p>
